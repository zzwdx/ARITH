This repository is about the paper **Balanced Direction from Multifarious Choices: Arithmetic Meta-Learning for Domain Generalization**.

The code for this algorithm is integrated into branch v2 of our repository [MEDIC++](https://github.com/zzwdx/MEDIC-plus) (branch still WIP, but this part is done).
